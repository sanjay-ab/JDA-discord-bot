# JDA-discord-bot
A simple Discord bot built using Java with the JDA api that allows users to play a version of liars dice together.

An object of the "Listener" class is added to the event listeners and when the keyword !dice is typed in the discord chat a listener of type "dice" is added to event listeners and bound to the channel in which it was defined in. Then the players play the game between them and type the final bet of each round in the discord chat. The bot then tracks who's successful and how many dice each person has.

This is still a work in progress and may be updated in the future.
